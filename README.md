## Objectives:
To showcase all the Quranic places, people and prophets in an interactive world map. Such a placement of Quranic anthropology would help in developing a geo-spatial understanding in the reader of Quran. This, we hope, would compel the reader to ponder over new perspectives and ask some new questions which otherwise, in a paper-only representation, may be difficult to venture upon.  
We do understand the contestations with regard to the present day world map. We hope that the readers would consider these nuances while exploring the interactive Atlas of Quran.

### Atlas of Quran (AoQ) offers:
1. An interactive world map.
2. Geo-locations of prophets, places and people mentioned in the Quran.
3. Relevant Quranic verses and Ahadees.
4. Other resources like images, references to related topics & research.  
5. An interactive network graph of Quranic topics, prophets, people and places.  

> The attempt here is to demonstrate a model of newer ways of cultivating intimate engagement with Quran and embarking on unique journeys of Quranic exploration and meaning making.
